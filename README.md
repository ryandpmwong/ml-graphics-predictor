# ML Graphics Predictor

This project combines Machine Learning (ML) techniques with Computer Graphics.
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used to predict the position and size of an object in 3D space, using only a 2D image of the space as input.
Computer graphics techniques are used to render the environment which generates the inputs for the CNN.
